  name: FamilyAudit-Classifier
  description: >
    A multiclass sequence classifier based on BERT base Italian, fine-tuned on corpora
    from municipalities and organizations. It predicts labels from a taxonomy to
    categorize Family Audit plans given a title, description, and objective. The model
    is designed for further fine-tuning on new data, including domains outside of the Family Audit's.
